Howto: Install Debian & ArchLinuxARM on a empty hard drive for Iomega® Home Media Network Hard Drive, Cloud Edition:

Warning:

By doing anything that follows, you could:
	Loose all data on you device
	Void your warranty
or any combination of the above. So don't proceed unless you know what you're doing and you mean it.

Prerequisites:

You will need
	A blank, or to-be-blanked SATA HDD.
	A linux system (or vm, or live cd/usb) in order to use the commands, scripts & files.
	Your linux system already installed parted and gzip.

Procedure:
	Attach the SATA HDD to the machine/vm you will use for this process.
	Power up the machine/vm and normal boot up;
	Recognize your HDD's divice name, For example, here will be used /dev/sdX or sdX
	Download boot sectors data file BootSectors.tgz and save to your machine/vm's /tmp directory;
	Extract BootSectors.tgz to /tmp/boot;
		command:
			mkdir /tmp/boot
			tar -C /tmp/boot -zxf BootSectors.tgz
	Create new partition table and filesystem on HDD(default rootfs partition size:20GB);
		command:
			cd /tmp/boot
			./mkgptdisk.sh /dev/sdX #[if you want msdos part, command: ./mkdosdisk.sh /dev/sdX]
	[Option]:Create second partition (user data partition) on HDD and format it;
		command:
			parted /dev/sdX mkpart primary 21.5GB -1s
			mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdX2
	Write boot sectors data to HDD;
		command:
			cd /tmp/boot
			./flushsd.sh /dev/sdX
	Download rootfs file(Debian.tgz or ArchLinuxARM.tgz) and save to your machine/vm's /tmp directory;
	Mount HDD's first partition and extract rootfs to it;
		command:
			mkdir /tmp/mydisk
			mount /dev/sdX1 /tmp/mydisk
			cd /tmp
			tar -C /tmp/mydisk -zvxf Debian.tgz #[or archlinux: tar -C /tmp/mydisk -zvxf ArchLinuxARM.tgz]
			sync
			umount /dev/sdX1
	Shut down the machine/vm and remove HDD;
	Attach the drive to your Iomega HMNHDCE;
	Apply power to the device and power up, Your device will normal boot to the Debian [or ArchLinuxARM] system.

Note:
	This Debian [or ArchLinuxARM] system already installed openssh and start the service at bootup, username and password both are root;
	The locale and language setting of this Debian [or ArchLinuxARM] system is chinese, you need reconfigure;
	In this Debian system, apt-get package server in /etc/apt/sources.list used Debian mirror server in china, you can read http://www.debian.org/mirror/list and reconfigure;
	In this Debian [or ArchLinuxARM] systen, HMNHDCE's powerbutton is redefined as:
		Press once: After 8 seconds, system will restart network service;
		Press twice (In 8 seconds, after first press): After 5 seconds, system will reboot;
		Press triple (In 5 seconds, after second press): System will shut down immediately;
		This redefined depend on package screen, it already include in this system;
	You may need regenerate ssh service's key:
		command:
			ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
			ssh-keygen -t dsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
